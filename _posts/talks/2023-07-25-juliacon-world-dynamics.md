### Summary

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In this workshop, we are going to present the package functionalities with hands-on examples using several of the currently available models. Initially, we start with a general explanation of the package, emphasizing how it is being developed. Subsequently, we proceed with the major demonstration of the package's main features via practical coding cases, including the reproduction of the original figures from implemented historical models using PlotJS.jl. We also show how to alter the values of parameters, tables, and edit equations of models, leveraging the package modular approach to combine different subsystems in ways that were not easily achievable previously. Finally, we present the development roadmap, which includes current works under construction, our expectations for the near future, and what we intend to achieve in the next major releases.
