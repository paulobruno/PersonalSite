<p style="text-align:left;">
I'm a <b>Research Engineer</b> in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/coati">COATI Project-Team</a>, working with <i>Neural Network Optimization</i>, under the supervision of CNRS researcher <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Emanuele.Natale">Emanuele Natale</a> @<a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur">Inria</a>. In my spare time <small><small>(when I'm not playing video games)</small></small>, I do research on <i>Deep Reinforcement Learning</i>.
</p>

## Education

<p style="text-align:left;">
I received a Master's degree in Computer Science in 2018 from the <a href="https://www.ufc.br/">Federal University of Ceara</a> (UFC) in Brazil, under the supervision of <a href="lattes.cnpq.br/0866205347972203">Prof. Joaquim Bento</a>, and a <i>Magna Cum Laude</i> Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2015, also from UFC.
</p>

## Interests

<p style="text-align:left;">
My current Deep Reinforcement Learning interests include multi-agent cooperation and competition, emulation of human play styles in Non-Player Characters, and interpretability of autonomous agents. Other research interests include Neural Network Optimization, Computer Vision, and world modeling and simulation.
