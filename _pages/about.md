I'm a <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning researcher</b>, currently moving my research forward in my spare time. I received a Master's degree in Computer Science in 2018 from the Federal University of Ceara (UFC) in Brazil, and a BSc in Computer Science in 2015, also from UFC.

<p style="text-align:left;">
My current Deep Reinforcement Learning interests include multi-agent cooperation and competition, emulation of human play styles in Non-Player Characters, and interpretability of autonomous agents. Other research interests include Neural Network optimization, Computer Vision, and world modelling and simulation.

When I'm not playing video games or reading papers, I work as a <b>Research Engineer</b> @<a href="https://team.inria.fr/coati">COATI Project-Team</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Emanuele.Natale">Emanuele Natale</a> @<a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur">Inria</a>. Earlier, I worked with Computational Geometry applied to 3D printing, Computer Vision for human segmentation, Optical Character Recognition, and Data Science @<a href="https://www.atlantico.com.br">Instituto Atl√¢ntico</a>. Before, I worked with digital image processing for Biometrics and fingerprint segmentation with Deep Neural Networks @<a href="https://www.great.ufc.br/">GREat</a>.
