I'm a <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning researcher</b>, currently moving my research forward in my spare time. I've got a M.S degree in Computer Science in 2018 from the Federal University of Ceara (UFC) in Brazil, and a B.S in Computer Science in 2015, also from UFC. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
My current research interests include applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent cooperation and competition, and visualization of neural networks.

When I'm not playing video games or reading papers, I work as a C/C++ and Python developer @<a href="https://www.atlantico.com.br">Instituto Atl√¢ntico</a>, applying computational geometry for 3D printing solutions. Earlier, I worked with digital image processing for biometrics and fingerprint segmentation with deep neural networks @<a href="https://www.great.ufc.br/">GREat</a>.
